# Hello_World

## Description

Two characteristics of mine that have impacted me throughout my life have always been adaptability and integrity. These traits have shined through everything I 
do from accepting different job positions to going on service trips around the world. As I continue my education at the University of Iowa as a third-year 
Business Analytics and Information Systems student, I am striving to enhance my understanding of the business field and how to set myself up to excel in it.
I am currently exploring my opportunities in the business education world and can't wait to find out what is next for me and my career. I've always had a passion
for work that permits and encourages creativity as it seems to bring out my best.
